- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @veulegede. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Windows, Mac OSX, Linux and Virual Machines. 
  The possibilities to connect with each other, to make a server for sharing data and applications, 
  how to make it stable and accessible from the outside. 
  I also want to learn how to build a Minecraft Server (for my son and his friends) and all I need to do 
  to securely let access (port forwarding,...). 
  I also want to learn how to use Git, ... 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use old OS in Virtual Machines to make old devices working again.
